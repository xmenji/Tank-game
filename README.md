# Tank-game

The Tank Game is one of the projects I worked on for my class CSC 413.

The Tank Game is required to have the following:
Must have 2 players
Must have tanks that move forwards and backwards
Must have tanks that rotate so they can move in all directions
Must have split screen
Must have a mini-map
Must have health bars for each tank
Must have lives count for each tank
Must have power up
Must have unbreakable walls
Must have breakable walls
Must have tanks that can shoot bullets that collide with walls
Must have tanks that can shoot bullets that collide with other tanks


The main objective in the Tank Game is simply to beat your opponent in versus mode. The players attack each other until one of them runs out of lives.
